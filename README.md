# MyCarDoesntWantToStopDrifting

MyCarDoesntWantToStopDrifting is a Unity 3D project <b>(v2022.3.6f1)</b> simulating a car that cannot stop drifting (it's a lie) with realtime suspensions that works with spring made in C# scripts.

### Features

- Driving around with a car
- <b> Some suspensions that look and feel really good to play with </b>
- Unity scripts components with a lot of variables to tweak (Suspensions, Steering, Motor/Brake force, Air friction, Grip ,...)
- Uncommented C# scripts
- A bad camera follow
- Half of a track with some sort of collision and a looping

### How To Install/Use
 Once the project is cloned, simply hop on Unity Hub and click on <i>"Add project from disk"</i> from the drop-down menu next to <i>"Open"</i>. Make sure you have already installed Unity Editor v2022.3.6f1 (you can launch in other versions but it may doesn't work). 
 Then in Unity click on play to launch the game in the SampleScene and try it out. <br> <br> To modify any variable get it's script component in the hierarchy and change the value in the inspector (be careful if you are trying to modify a variable in the wheels object, select all the wheels and not just one).
